# Social Bubble Rules

Most of the rules can be summarized by the following key tenets

- Wash your hands when you get home
- Sanitize hands after touching things
- Try and maintain a six foot distance from people
- Wear a mask when ambulatory or in a non-member indoor setting
- If a member is exposed to a non-member who is exhibiting Covid-like symptoms a two-week social bubble break may be called

## Contact with people outside of social bubble

Outdoor social gatherings are permissable in both public and private spaces as long as members adhere to the guidelines below

- **Alert members when interacting with non-members in a social setting**
- Members wear a mask when moving to or from designated six foot buffered zone
- Members maintain a six foot distance from people outside of the social bubble
- The use of public bathrooms is allowed provided the member wears a mask and washes hands. Sanitizing hands after leaving the bathroom is encouraged
- Food and dish sharing is allowed provided the member washes the dish and their hands afterwards
- People outside of social bubble may enter a member's home for bathroom use provided they have a mask on and the bathroom area is disinfected before and after the social gathering
- Cooper may be petted by people outside of the social bubble, but members must be wary of non-member exhibiting Covid-like symptoms

## Shopping

- Mask are mandatory when shopping
- Members must attempt to maintain distance from other shoppers
- Members must sanitize their hands when they return to their cars after the grocery trip
- If a member phone is used as a grocery list it must be sanitized when home
- Grocery packaging must be sanitized when home before groceries are put away

## Dining

- Only take-out is permissable
- Do not eat out of pre-packaged take-out containers

## Exercise

- Exercising without a mask is allowed in low population areas where the member can reasonably be expected to maintain a six-foot distance
- A mask must be worn when exercising in a high population area or in an area where the member suspects the six-foot distance rule may be broken

## Work

- Jana has been approved for going in for builds
- Other members will be considered for at-work approval on a case-by-case basis
- Close proximity to workers may call for a social bubble break, but the group will rely on Jana's judgement for high-risk situations

## Home cleaning

**Home cleaning may be a deal-breaker. We await group approval on this topic, but some suggestions are provided below**

- The professional and the member must wear masks and maintain a six-foot distance while a cleaning is taking place
- The member may go to another member's residence or be outside of the home for the entire duration of the cleaning
